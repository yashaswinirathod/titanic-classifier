Building a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic 
involves several steps, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, 
and evaluation. Here's a basic outline of how you can accomplish this using Python:
 1.Import Libraries:
 Start by importing necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn.
 2.Load the Dataset: 
Load the Titanic dataset into a pandas DataFrame
  3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Explore the dataset to understand its structure, check for missing values, and gain insights into the features.
4.Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform feature scaling if necessary.
5. Feature Engineering:
Create new features or modify existing ones that might improve the predictive power of the model.
6.Split Data:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
7.Model Selection: 
Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification. Common choices include logistic regression,
  decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting algorithms.
8.Model Training: 
Train the selected models on the training data.
  9.Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall,
and F1-score. Also, visualize the results using confusion matrices or ROC curves.
10.Hyperparameter Tuning: 
Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the chosen model to improve its performance.
11.Final Model Selection:
Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
